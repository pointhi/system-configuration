# system-configuration

This repo was simply born because I was forced to do a complete os installation again (which happens not very often).
To simplify this task the next time, I'm building this repo to get all important configurations and packages at one place.

I'm using [Antergos](https://antergos.com) as main OS, which is [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) with fancy installer
and some custom packages.
